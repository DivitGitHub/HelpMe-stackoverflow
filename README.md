# HelpMe-stackoverflow

## Personal project

I wanted to explore and advance my technical knowledge which is the reason why I created this simple android application.
This application waits for the user query(questions) and then "fetch" data from the api and displays a list.
When list is clicked on, it redirects the user to the site with the answers.
I've used stackoverflow API, RxJava, Retrofit, ButterKnife and Gson converter, RecyclerView and CardView for this application.
