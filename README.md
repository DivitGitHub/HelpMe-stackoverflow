### Personal project

I wanted to explore and learn more technologies which is the reason I created this test application.
This application waits for the user query(questions) and then "fetch" data from the api and displays a list.
When list is clicked on, it redirects the user to the site with the answers.
I've used RxJava, Retrofit, ButterKnife and Gson converter, RecyclerView and CardView for this application.


Starting screen:

Displays a list related to the user query:
